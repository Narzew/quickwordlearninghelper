QuickWordLearningHelper v 3.00 by Narzew

Software to learning words in different languages and more :)

You change language in lang.ini

How to use program ??

Type the wordlist name.
All wordlists files put in the Wordlists/ directory.
The computer says a word.
You must put an answer.
:-)
That's all

IF YOU SEE AN ERROR : Error loading language...
Paste you language file into Languages/ folder.
Type the name (without .dat) in the lang.ini

How to make your own language file??

Simple! Use LanguageEditor builded tool.
Generated lang.dat rename and copy to game dir and have your custom language :-)
Can be problems with non ASCII-7BIT characters.

How to make your own wordlist ??

Create a file with a structure:

word     answer
word2     answer2
word3     answer3

Take 5 blank spaces beetween word and answer.
Save into file and use Wordlist Compiler tool

Compile your words collection and you now can :

- use it in program
- share with the friends
- share with net :)

Remember that :

- wordlists must have .dat extension
- wordlists must be putted in Wordlist/ directory
- wordlists must be compiled

That's all to know.
Never give uncompilled collections to friends!!!

Wanna test?
Try example collection!
Type 'example' in collection select scene :)

Comment to verison 3.00

What gives 'wordlist reversing'?

This reverses polish, for ex. if you have polish-english wordlist, if you reverse them you get english-polish worldist etc.

See changelog.txt !!! :)
